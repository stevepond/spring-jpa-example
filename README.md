# Spring JPA Example

This is a minimal Kotlin + Spring Boot project demonstrating how to map two entities, `Author` and `Book`, using JPA/Hibernate.

## Building

Run the following command to build the project:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

The build uses an in-memory H2 database and creates the schema automatically at startup.
